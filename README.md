DiTTo is a _Distribution Transformation Tool_ that aims at providing an open source framework to convert various distribution systems modeling formats.
DiTTo implements a _many-to-one-to-many_ parsing framework which makes it modular and robust.
Readers and writers are then implemented to perform the translation from a given format to the core representation, or the other way around.


## Quick Start

### Install DiTTo

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NREL/ditto.git@v0.2.2#egg=ditto[all]
```

### Basic Usage

source=http://sites.ieee.org/pes-testfeeders/resources/

The most basic capability of DiTTo is the conversion of a distribution system from one format to another. Let's say we have the IEEE 4 node feeder in OpenDSS format as a file called ```master.dss```:

```
clear

new circuit.4BusYYbal basekV=12.47 phases=3

!Wires definition
new wiredata.conductor Runits=mi Rac=0.306 GMRunits=ft GMRac=0.0244  Radunits=in Diam=0.721
new wiredata.neutral   Runits=mi Rac=0.592 GMRunits=ft GMRac=0.00814 Radunits=in Diam=0.563

!LineGeometry definition
new linegeometry.4wire nconds=4 nphases=3 reduce=yes cond=1 wire=conductor units=ft x=-4 h=28 cond=2 wire=conductor units=ft x=-1.5 h=28 cond=3 wire=conductor units=ft x=3 h=28 cond=4 wire=neutral units=ft x=0    h=24

!Lines definition
new line.line1 geometry=4wire length=2000 units=ft bus1=sourcebus bus2=n2
new line.line2 bus1=n3 bus2=n4 geometry=4wire length=2500 units=ft

!Transformer definition
new transformer.t1 xhl=6 wdg=1 bus=n2 conn=wye kV=12.47 kVA=6000 %r=0.5 wdg=2 bus=n3 conn=wye kV=4.16  kVA=6000 %r=0.5

!Load definiion
new load.load1 phases=3 bus1=n4 conn=wye kV=4.16 kW=5400 pf=0.9  model=1 vminpu=0.75

!Set voltage base and solve circuit
set voltagebases=[12.47, 4.16]
calcvoltagebases
solve
```

To convert this system to another format, say CYME for example, the easiest way is to use the command line interface. From the directory where ```master.dss``` is located, run:

```bash
$ ditto-cli convert --from opendss --to cyme --input ./master.dss --output .
```

This command basically reads the OpenDSS input (```./master.dss```) into the DiTTo core representation and output the system to CYME (since the output is ".", the files will be written in the same folder).

After running this command you should see the output in the current directory:

```bash
$ ls | grep .txt
./equipment.txt
./loads.txt
./network.txt
```
